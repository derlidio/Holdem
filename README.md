# Hold'em Solitaire

This was my first experience with Defold and Lua programming. I'm not exactly proud
of this code, but it shows how one can get from zero to something when it comes to
learning a new programming language or framework from scratch. The first version of
this game was made in C++ for PC (Windows). The original concept was born during my
attendance of the Digital Games Design course at Cruzeiro do Sul university from 
2007 to 2008. Since then it kept getting dust in my drawer (digital dust, digital
drawer) for a long time. When the pandemic came about, I decided to give it another
chance.

Also available for free on Google Play and App Store.

This project is available under the MIT license agreement, but I have to emphasize
that some assets (images) were licensed from FreePik Premium, and this license is
not transferable. Basically, all shields, swords, and crowns icons came from there.

The rest of the assets are original art made by me, including images, sound fx,
and soundtrack.

So, be warned that this code is free to use, but the assests are not!
